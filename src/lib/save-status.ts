// A tiny app-wide save-status signal (Brandon feedback, 2026-06-17). The item
// canvas autosaves from many independent surfaces — the title, the body editor,
// each field strip, each custom property, each relation field — and with the
// field-level grid (ADR-069) those surfaces are scattered across the layout, so
// a per-component "Saved" badge is easy to lose track of. This module is the one
// place they all report into, so a single floating SaveStatusIndicator can always
// show the current state.
//
// A module-level singleton (not React context) on purpose: it has to span both
// the classic stacked canvas (where the panels are server-rendered straight into
// the page) and the grid (where they're nodes inside the client grid), with no
// common client provider above them. Components import beginSave/endSave; the
// indicator subscribes via useSaveStatus.
